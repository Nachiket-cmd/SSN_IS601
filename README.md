- **Mobile Optimization**: Ensure the platform is fully responsive for mobile devices, enabling customers to book appointments on the go.

### Additional Enhancements:

- **Marketing Tools**: Integrated tools for email campaigns, promotional offers, and social media integration to help salons attract and retain customers.
