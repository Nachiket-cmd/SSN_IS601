# Overview of Salon / Barbershop Customer Journey Epics

This document presents a series of customer journey epics, each tailored to a specific client initiative and experience with a salon or barbershop. These narratives are designed to illustrate the typical path a customer might take, from initial awareness to becoming a loyal patron. The journeys cover a diverse range of client needs and preferences, highlighting how different individuals with unique requirements — such as eco-friendliness, advanced hair treatment technologies, or budget-friendly options — engage with salon services.

Each epic is structured into four phases:

1. **Awareness**: The customer's initial discovery of the salon or service that fits their specific needs.
2. **Interest**: The stage where the customer shows interest in the services after being attracted by specific aspects such as technology, sustainability, or pricing.
3. **Action**: The customer's decisive step to engage with the salon, like booking an appointment or purchasing a product.
4. **Loyalty**: The post-service phase where the salon works to retain the customer through follow-up offers, loyalty programs, or community involvement.

These narratives serve as a blueprint for understanding customer interactions and enhancing their experiences. They are not only beneficial for marketing and customer relationship management but also provide valuable insights into the diverse needs and expectations of salon clients.
